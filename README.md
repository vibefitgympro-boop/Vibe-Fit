## eSSL / eBioServer biometric attendance

The Admin **Attendance** workspace includes an eSSL integration setup. Apply `supabase/migrations/20261004170000_essl_attendance_webhook.sql` before configuring it, then deploy the site so Netlify publishes `netlify/functions/essl-attendance.mjs`.

1. In Admin → Attendance, register each eSSL terminal using its serial number and map the terminal's `EmployeeCode` / `User ID` to the corresponding CRM member.
2. Generate the secure webhook URL once and copy it. The app stores only a SHA-256 hash of its token; if the URL is lost, rotate it and replace the old URL in eBioServer.
3. In eBioServer New → Utilities → Web Hook, set the URL, enable delivery, disable payload encryption, and set the response body to `{"StatusCode":"200","Message":"Success"}`. The endpoint requires HTTPS and the secret URL token.
4. Send a test punch, then check Attendance/dashboard activity. The receiver accepts eBioServer `EmployeeCode` / `LogDate` fields and older `UserId` / `LogDateTime` fields. It maps the device serial plus employee ID, checks gym-local membership eligibility, deduplicates device events, and records at most one attendance check-in per member per local day.

Only punch metadata is stored. Fingerprint templates remain on the biometric terminal. The webhook URL contains a secret; do not share it or post screenshots containing it.

## Connect a Supabase project during first admin setup

When the app is built without a Supabase URL or publishable key, the blank database form opens on `/auth` before sign-in or registration. If the app already has a connection, choose **Create an account**, then **Need to connect a Supabase project first?**. The service-role key is sent only to the Netlify Function and stored in Netlify's server-side environment settings; it is not written to browser storage or returned to the page. Netlify encrypts environment-variable values at rest. Saving the connection queues a new production build because the browser Supabase URL and publishable key are embedded during the build.

Before using the form, the Netlify site owner must do this one-time deployment setup:

1. Create the Supabase project and apply this repository's migrations in timestamp order (or link the project and run `supabase db push`). The project schema must exist before the first admin signs up.
2. Create a Netlify personal access token with permission to manage this site's environment variables and trigger builds.
3. In Netlify **Project configuration → Environment variables**, add these server-side bootstrap variables, then deploy the app once so the setup function is available:
   - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` — the Netlify API token; keep private.
   - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` — this Netlify site's project/site ID.
   - `SUPABASE_SETUP_TOKEN` — a random code of at least 32 characters that the person connecting Supabase will enter in the form.
   - `NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_ID` — optional if the site API response already identifies its team; otherwise set the account/team slug or ID.
4. Open `/auth`, create an account, and connect the Supabase URL, publishable key, project ID, service-role key, and setup access code. Wait for the new production deploy to finish, then create the admin account.

The setup endpoint can change the database connection for this deployment, so share the setup access code only with the site owner. After initial setup, remove `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `SUPABASE_SETUP_TOKEN` from Netlify to disable further in-app changes; add them back only when intentionally changing the connected project. Keep the service-role key server-side and never use it as a `VITE_` variable.

## Membership renewal reminder emails

Netlify runs `netlify/functions/membership-renewal-reminders.mjs` daily at 02:00 UTC. It uses the gym timezone to find active memberships due for a reminder: the first email is sent 7 days before expiry and the follow-up 4 days before expiry. Delivery attempts are stored in `renewal_reminders` to avoid duplicate emails and retry failures.

Before enabling it in production:

1. Apply `supabase/migrations/20260929120000_membership_renewal_email_delivery.sql` and `supabase/migrations/20261001090000_admin_gmail_oauth_settings.sql` to the Supabase project.
2. Keep these server-side Netlify environment variables configured:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (keep this secret; never expose it as a `VITE_` variable)
   - `APP_URL` (optional; used to add a sign-in link to the email)
   - `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (optional; use a long random secret to encrypt Gmail OAuth credentials separately. If omitted, the server derives the encryption key from `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Keep whichever key is used stable; if rotated, reconnect Gmail in Settings.)
3. Publish a Netlify production deploy. Scheduled functions run on published deploys; Netlify’s Functions page can invoke this scheduled function manually for an immediate delivery check.

### Configure Gmail API OAuth

The reminder sender uses the Gmail API's `gmail.send` permission. In Google Cloud, create a project, enable the Gmail API, configure the OAuth consent screen, and create a **Web application** OAuth client. From Admin **Settings → Membership reminder email**, copy the displayed callback URL and add it as an authorized redirect URI on the Google OAuth client. Paste the OAuth client ID and client secret into the same Settings panel and choose **Save credentials and connect Gmail**. Google then asks the administrator to authorize the Gmail account used to send reminders. The app encrypts the OAuth client secret and refresh token before storing them in its private Supabase table; neither value is sent back to the browser.

Administrators can click the dashboard’s **Expiring in 7 days** card to view members with active memberships expiring today through seven days from today in the gym timezone. The list provides one manual email reminder per membership; a manual send is recorded separately from the scheduled seven-day and follow-up reminders.

### Supabase Send Email Auth Hook

The `supabase/functions/send-email` Edge Function sends Supabase Auth emails through the Gmail OAuth sender connected in Admin Settings. It handles signup confirmation, password recovery, magic links, invitations, email changes, and reauthentication. Apply `supabase/migrations/20261002120000_admin_send_email_auth_hook.sql` after the other migrations.

The first administrator can register with Supabase's built-in email sender. After signing in, connect Gmail in Admin **Settings → Membership reminder email**, then use the **Member authentication emails** section below it to enable the hook. Enter a scoped Supabase personal access token with project-level Auth Config read/write, Project Admin write, and Edge Function Secrets write permissions. The token is used only for the configuration request and is not stored. The app securely creates the hook signing secret, sets the Edge Function secret, and enables the Send Email Auth Hook through Supabase's Management API. Keep the Email provider enabled. The Admin Settings page can also disable the hook to return to Supabase's built-in email sender.

Before using the settings flow, deploy the function once. For GitHub Actions deployment, add repository secrets `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`; the workflow deploys this function when its code or Supabase configuration changes on `main`. The deployment token needs Edge Functions write permission. The function can also be deployed manually with `supabase functions deploy send-email --project-ref <project-ref>`.

The function reads encrypted Gmail credentials from the private `gym_gmail_oauth` table using Supabase's server-side service key. If Netlify has `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` configured, the setup action copies that value into Supabase Edge Function Secrets so the function can decrypt the credentials. Otherwise, the function uses the same project's injected service-role key fallback used by the app.

## Payment gateway setup

Apply `supabase/migrations/20261001100000_admin_payment_gateway_credentials.sql` to the connected Supabase project. In Admin **Settings**, use **Payment gateway integrations** to securely save Razorpay Key ID and Key Secret, or Stripe Secret Key and webhook signing secret. The keys are encrypted server-side in a private Supabase table; blank fields keep their existing saved values. The optional server variable `PAYMENT_CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` provides a separate encryption key; if omitted, the app derives it from `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Keep that key stable, or re-enter the gateway credentials if you rotate it.

For Stripe, register the webhook URL shown in Settings and subscribe to `checkout.session.completed` and `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`. Existing `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` server variables remain available as fallback credentials for deployments that have not moved their keys into Settings.

Use an OAuth app publishing status of **In production** for a long-lived refresh token. Google expires refresh tokens issued while an external OAuth app is in **Testing** after seven days for scopes such as `gmail.send`. Google classifies `gmail.send` as a sensitive scope, so an unverified app can show a warning; Google verification may be required for public distribution. Never put OAuth secrets or refresh tokens in frontend variables, source control, or chat. See Google's [Gmail OAuth scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/auth/scopes), [OAuth web-server flow](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/auth/web-server), and [OAuth refresh-token guidance](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration).
